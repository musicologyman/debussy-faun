= Listening Guide: Debussy, "`Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun`"

:nofooter:

Debussy's "`Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun`" begins with a flute solo
that will recur throughout the piece. At the beginning, we hear it four
times, each varied slightly and extended by an answer from other instrumental
groups or by an elaboration of the melody by the flute itself. In fact, it`'s
useful for us to hear this as a *four-breath opening.* 

'''

*Time: 0:00* +
The *first breath* begins with flute alone.

The harp and horns answer the flute solo, stating the same idea twice,
extending it slightly the second time.

'''

*Time: 0:43* + 
The *second breath* is like the first.
The flute repeats the solo from the beginning, but instead of presenting it
without any accompaniment (as was the case at the beginning), Debussy
supports the flute warm, quiet chords played by the strings. When the flute arrives at the end of the solo, the oboe takes up the line and
leads the orchestra to the end of the second breath.

'''

*Time: 1:35* +
In the *third breath,* Debussy varies and expands the solo. While the head motive had been repeated twice in succession in the <<example-1,first breath>>, Debussy interpolates a whimsical elboration between the two statements of the head motive and repeats the second statement at a slightly lower pitch level than the first:

'''
*Time: 2:13* +
The *fourth breath* is the most elaborate yet. This time, after the initial statement of the head motive, Debussy speeds it up, repeating it three times before continuing and bringing the fourth breath to a quiet conclusion:

*Time: 2:47* +
The foregoing reverie is interrupted when the clarinet takes up an
agitated variation on the flute's solo:

*Time: 3:15* +
At this point, the oboe initiates a transition to the middle
section of the piece. The oboe's melody culminates in a motive that
we'll call a "`transitional motive,`" not because the motive itself is used to effect transitions but, rather, because Debussy introduces it in this transitional segement:

The orchestra embarks on a long crescendo that culminates and quickly fades into a brief transition into the middle of the piece based on the
